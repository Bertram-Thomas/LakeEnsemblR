\title{Function to plot results of the ensemble run}
\usage{
plot_ensemble(
  ncdf,
  model = c("FLake", "GLM", "GOTM", "Simstrat", "MyLake"),
  var = "watertemp",
  dim = "model",
  dim_index = 1,
  depth = NULL,
  date = NULL,
  av_fun = "mean",
  boxwhisker = FALSE,
  residuals = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ncdf}{Path to the netcdf file created by `run_ensemble()`}

\item{model}{Vector of models which should be included in the plot}

\item{var}{Variable which to plot. Defaults to "watertemp".}

\item{dim}{character; NetCDF dimensions to extract. Must be either "member" or "model". Defaults to "model". Only used if plotting from netCDF file. Currently only works with "model".}

\item{dim_index}{numeric; Index of dimension chosen to extract from. Defaults to 1. Only used if plotting from netCDF file.}

\item{depth}{If `var` has a depth dimension, for which depth should it be plotted?}

\item{date}{Specific date for which depth profiles should be plotted}

\item{av_fun}{Averaging function to use, defaults to the arithmetic mean (`mean()`)}
}
\description{
Plot the outcome of the ensemble run for a given depth along with the minimum, maximum, and
an average value.
