\title{Analyse the output netCDF}
\usage{
analyse_ncdf(ncdf, model, spin_up = 0, drho = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{ncdf}{filepath; to the `ensemble_output.nc` file}

\item{model}{Vector of models for which to calculate the performance measures}

\item{spin_up}{numeric; Number of days to disregard as spin-up for analysis.}

\item{drho}{numeric; density difference between top and bottom indicating stratification
[kg m^-3]}
}
\value{
list of four dataframes: 'out_df' = long data frame with date, depths, temp and model,
'stats' = summary statistics of model fitness compared to observed and mean differences between modelled and observed phenological events,
'strat' = stratification statistics for each year,
'obs_temp' = long dataframe of observed data within the netCDF file
