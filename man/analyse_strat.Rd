\title{Returns stratification statstics}
\usage{
analyse_strat(Ts, Tb, H_ice = NULL, dates, drho = 0.1, NH = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Ts}{vector;  of surface temperatures which corresponds to date vector}

\item{Tb}{vector; of bottom temperatures which corresponds to date vector}

\item{H_ice}{vector; of ice thickness which corresponds to date vector, set to NULL if analysis not required. Defaults to NULL}

\item{dates}{vector; of POSIX style date corresponding to rows of Ts and Tb.}

\item{drho}{numeric; density difference between top and bottom indicating stratificaiton [kg m^-3]}

\item{NH}{boolean; northern hemisphere? TRUE or FALSE. Defaults to true}
}
\description{
Returns stratification statstics: annual mean, max and total
length of summer, winter stratification and ice duration.
NOTE: summer strat periods are allocated to the year in which the period starts. Winter stratification and ice periods are allocated to the year in which they end.

\examples{
\dontrun{
strat <- analyse_strat(Ts = df[,2], Tb = df[,ncol(df)], dates = df[,1])
